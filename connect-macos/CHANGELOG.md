## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-07-15

Canary release used to verify 0.5.2's streamDownload timeout fix
end-to-end. Content identical to 0.5.2 aside from the version
bump. Verified: 0.5.2 → 0.5.3 auto-update succeeded on the box
that previously failed with 0.5.0 → 0.5.1 timeout.

Users on 0.5.0 / 0.5.1 still hit the old timeout while pulling
this version — same as trying to pull 0.5.2. Escape hatch is a
one-time manual install:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xphuong/nexguard-releases/main/install.sh | bash
```

Once 0.5.2+ is on disk, auto-update is reliable for future releases.

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-15

Fixes "download timed out, try again on a faster connection"
error that hit users on corporate / captive-portal networks
while auto-updating from 0.5.0 → 0.5.1.

### Fixed

- **Auto-update DMG download failing with `NSURLErrorTimedOut`**
  while manual `curl` / browser downloads of the same URL
  succeeded. The old `streamDownload` used `URLSession.shared`
  with `request.timeoutInterval = 30`, which is an *idle*
  timeout — no bytes for 30 s means fail even though overall
  bandwidth is fine. Corp proxies + captive portals routinely
  stall byte streams for 30–60 s during TCP window ramp-up or
  proxy re-handshake.

  Fix uses a dedicated `URLSession` with:
    * `timeoutIntervalForRequest = 120` (idle tolerance, 4× the
      old value)
    * `timeoutIntervalForResource = 900` (overall 15-min ceiling)
    * `waitsForConnectivity = true` (rides out brief blips)

  Error message reworded — "try on a faster connection"
  misdiagnosed the root cause (URLSession idle timeout, not
  bandwidth). New text points at the manual install one-liner
  as fallback.

### Upgrade path

Users stuck on 0.5.0 / 0.5.1 (auto-updater hits the same bug
pulling 0.5.2): install manually via
`curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash`, then subsequent
auto-updates work.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-15

Fixes a zombie DNS state after sleep/wake — users on Wi-Fi saw
"no internet" after macOS put their laptop to sleep with the
tunnel up, because the system DNS was still pointing at the
tunnel resolver (e.g. `10.0.22.254`) that only exists inside the
VPN.

### Changed

- **Helper script `nexguard-wg-helper`** picks up a new `dns-reset`
  action. Iterates every enabled network service, and when the
  service's current DNS matches the tunnel DNS passed as `$2`,
  resets it to `Empty` (macOS's incantation for "revert to
  DHCP-provided"). Also flushes `mDNSResponder` so apps don't
  keep resolving from in-process cache. Idempotent.

- **`HelperInstaller`** gains `isCurrent()` + `ensureCurrent()`.
  On bootstrap, if the installed helper's SHA-256 differs from
  the version we ship, the app silently re-runs `install()` —
  one admin prompt per upgrade, then cache-hit forever.
  Operators upgrading 0.5.0 → 0.5.1 hit this once so their
  helper learns the new `dns-reset` action.

### Fixed

- **DNS stuck at tunnel resolver after sleep/wake.** When macOS
  suspends, the tunnel process typically dies without wg-quick's
  PostDown hook running, so system DNS remains pointed at
  `10.0.22.254`, which only lives inside the VPN. On wake the
  browser reports "no internet" because every DNS lookup fails.
  Fix is threefold:
    1. On `NSWorkspace.willSleepNotification`, if the tunnel is up,
       tear it down cleanly before macOS suspends — wg-quick's
       PostDown restores DNS the normal way inside the ~1-2s
       window macOS gives us.
    2. On `NSWorkspace.didWakeNotification`, if the tunnel is NOT
       active on wake (killed by sleep despite step 1), call the
       helper's `dns-reset` action to sweep lingering tunnel DNS
       off enabled network services.
    3. On app bootstrap, `cleanupOrphanTunnel()` also calls
       `restoreDns()` so a stale DNS state cannot survive an
       app restart after a crash.

### Known issues (carried over from 0.5.0)

- **PendingApproval flow on macOS 26.3.0** — still under
  investigation. Workaround: admin-approve the device from the
  portal (Devices → click device → Approve).

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-15

Portability release. The bundled `bash` binary now works on every
macOS 13.0+ machine without Homebrew, and ships as a Universal
Binary (arm64 + x86_64). Fixes `Library not loaded:
libncursesw.6.dylib` crash reported on macOS 15.7.7 (Sequoia).

### Changed

- **New `scripts/build-bash.sh`** builds `bash 5.2.37` from source,
  static-linked against `readline 8.2` and the system-provided
  ncurses (via SDK's `libncurses.tbd` — dyld shared cache carries
  this on every macOS 13.0+). Output is a Universal Binary with
  `LC_BUILD_VERSION minos = 13.0`. Cache-friendly.
- **`scripts/setup.sh`** no longer `cp`s `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash`.
  It invokes the new build script and verifies the produced binary
  has no `/opt/homebrew` or `/usr/local` deps before bundling.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — new "Multi-macOS-version bundling" section
  documenting the two independent trap categories (Mach-O
  deployment target inheritance + dynamic dylib absolute-path deps).

### Fixed

- **`Connect failed: wg-quick failed (exit 6): dyld[…] Library not
  loaded: libncursesw.6.dylib`** on macOS 15.7.7. Root cause was
  `setup.sh` copying Homebrew's bash straight into the app bundle,
  which:
    * Was built for macOS 26.0 (`LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX` inherited
      from the maintainer's Tahoe dev box).
    * Referenced `/opt/homebrew/opt/{ncurses,readline,gettext}/…`
      absolute paths that don't exist without matching Homebrew.
  Fix rebuilds bash from source targeting macOS 13.0 with only
  system libraries. Verified on macOS 15.7.7 + 26.5.1.

### Known issues

- **PendingApproval flow on macOS 26.3.0** — some users report the
  app landing in "Ready to connect" after sign-in even though the
  device is not yet admin-approved. Cannot reproduce on macOS
  26.5.1. Workaround: admin-approve the device from the portal
  (Devices → click device → Approve). Full postmortem in a
  follow-up release.

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-13

Additive telemetry release — pairs with NexGuard server 3.2.0.

### Added

- **Host OS + CPU architecture headers** on every request to the
  NexGuard server. `NexGuardClientHeaders.swift` now stamps three
  new headers in addition to the existing Platform/Version pair:

      X-NexGuard-Client-OS-Name      "macOS"
      X-NexGuard-Client-OS-Version   "14.3.1"   (formatted major.minor.patch)
      X-NexGuard-Client-Arch         "arm64" | "x86_64"

  OS version comes from `ProcessInfo.processInfo.operatingSystemVersion`.
  Arch comes from `sysctlbyname("hw.machine")` -- NOT Swift's
  `#if arch()`, because the latter reports BUILD arch and would
  hide Rosetta cases. On Apple Silicon running under Rosetta the
  header correctly reports `x86_64`, which is exactly the signal
  admins need when a user reports "app feels slow" on M-series
  hardware (native arm64 build missing → user is on Rosetta).

  Server (v3.2.0+) logs these into new `devices.client_os_name` /
  `client_os_version` / `client_arch` columns and surfaces them in
  the admin UI under the Client column (secondary line) + Device
  Details card (Operating System + Architecture rows). Older
  servers ignore the unknown headers -- no coordination required.

  Passive telemetry, best-effort ingestion, no enforcement gate.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-08

Bundle bash 4+ to fix `wg-quick: Version mismatch: bash 3 detected,
when bash 4+ required`. macOS ships `/bin/bash` = 3.2 (bash 4+
became GPLv3, Apple can't ship in base OS), but `wg-quick` script
requires bash 4+ (uses associative arrays). Previous 0.3.0 fell
over on any host without Homebrew bash on PATH.

### Fixed

- **`Connect failed: wg-quick failed (exit 1)`** — bundle Homebrew
  bash 5.x (~890 KB, arm64) into `App/Vendor/bin/bash` and invoke
  `wg-quick` as `bundledBash wg-quick up cfg` — bypasses the
  `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang (which resolves to `/bin/bash` 3.2
  on macOS).

### Changed

- **`scripts/setup.sh`** — new step 5.5: copy bash from
  `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` (Apple Silicon) or
  `/usr/local/bin/bash` (Intel); `brew install bash` if neither
  exists.
- **`App/Vendor/bin/nexguard-wg-helper`** — locate bash 4+
  (bundled first, Homebrew fallback), exit 3 with actionable
  message if none found.
- **`App/Tunnel/WgQuickRunner.swift`** — new `bundledBashPath()`
  with same discovery order; `bringUp`/`bringDown` compose the
  admin shell command as `PATH=... 'bash' 'wg-quick' <op> cfg`;
  `isAvailable()` now also requires bash 4+.

### Added

- **`README.txt`** trong DMG — hướng dẫn 3 bước cài (drag app ➜
  Terminal one-liner ➜ launch) kèm workaround qua System Settings
  cho user không muốn dùng Terminal. Giải thích ngắn vì sao có
  Gatekeeper warning (DMG chưa notarize, cần Apple Developer
  Program).

### Notes

- Bundled `bash` will be signed by `codesign --deep` alongside the
  rest of the app bundle when `SIGN=1` is set on `build-dmg.sh`.
- Currently arm64-only (matches the rest of the WireGuard tooling
  bundle). Universal 2 build would require `lipo`-merging bash
  from both Apple Silicon and Intel Homebrew prefixes.
- Proper fix cho Gatekeeper warning là đăng ký Apple Developer
  Program ($99/năm), tạo Developer ID cert, và notarize DMG qua
  `xcrun notarytool submit`. Đã có sẵn code path trong
  `build-dmg.sh` (`SIGN=1 NOTARIZE=1`). README.txt trong DMG là
  interim guide cho user tự work-around.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-04

Verify update downloads with SHA-256. Manifest now carries a
`sha256` field alongside each product entry; the in-app installer
(`AppState.installUpdate`) hashes the downloaded DMG in 1 MiB
chunks with CryptoKit and refuses to mount if it doesn't match.

Two failure surfaces added to the Failed panel:

- **Missing checksum** — manifest doesn't publish `sha256` for
  this product. Strict mode: refuse (no fallback). Message:
  *"This update can't be verified right now. Please try again
  later."*
- **Hash mismatch** — file downloaded but hash differs. Refuse
  before mounting so a hostile DMG can't even be opened by
  Finder. Message: *"The downloaded update doesn't match the
  expected checksum. This could mean the file was corrupted in
  transit, or the update source has been tampered with. Try
  again in a few minutes."*

Threat model this closes: an attacker who compromises the S3
bucket alone can no longer push a malicious DMG -- they'd also
need to compromise the GitHub-hosted manifest to publish a
matching hash. Manifest and artifact are on separate channels
with separate auth boundaries by design.

### Added

- **`App/API/UpdateChecker.swift`** — `Product.sha256` (optional
  in the schema); `UpdateStatus.available/.required` carry the
  hash through to callers.
- **`AppState.computeSHA256(fileURL:)`** — streaming hasher, 1 MiB
  chunks so a large DMG doesn't spike memory.
- **`scripts/build-dmg.sh`** — emits the SHA-256 of the built DMG
  as the final line for direct paste into `versions.json`.

### Changed

- **`AppState.installUpdate()`** — after `streamDownload`, verify
  the hash before mounting. Both missing-hash and mismatch paths
  route to the Failed panel with distinct messages.
- **`Views/ContentView.swift`** — install UI switched from
  `.sheet` to `.overlay`. The `.sheet` presentation misbehaves
  inside a MenuBarExtra popover (no NSWindow context, button
  clicks occasionally fell through and required a second tap to
  dismiss). Overlay lives inside the popover's layout tree and
  responds to state instantly.

Windows client parity for this hash-verify step is tracked
separately -- Windows still uses the pre-verify pipeline.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-04

In-app auto-update. The `Update available` banner + `Update
required` full-screen view now install the new release directly
from the app: download the DMG, mount it, swap
`/Applications/NexGuardConnect.app`, and relaunch the fresh build
automatically. No more Finder round-trip.

Parity with the Windows client's install pipeline
(`windows-v0.1.6+`); both platforms drive the same
Downloading → Preparing → Launching → (relaunch) state machine
with a matching non-dismissable sheet.

### Added

- **`App/State/UpdateInstallState.swift`** — install-pipeline state
  enum (`idle`, `downloading`, `preparing`, `launching`,
  `failed(String)`). Mirrors the Windows enum so both platforms
  drive the same UX.
- **`App/Views/UpdateWindow.swift`** — state-driven sheet with
  Downloading (determinate progress bar bound to
  `updateDownloadPercent`), Preparing, Launching, and Failed
  panels. Non-dismissable while in flight so a stray click can't
  orphan the download.
- **`AppState.installUpdate()`** — end-to-end pipeline:
  URLSession byte-stream download (coalesced % updates), DMG
  mount via `hdiutil`, restart helper spawn, then hard exit so
  the helper `ditto`-swaps `/Applications/NexGuardConnect.app`
  and relaunches the new build. Detached bash helper watches the
  caller PID (up to 5 min) before it fires.
- Failure path: HTTP + `NSURLError` mapped to plain-English text
  in the Failed panel with `Close` + `Try again` buttons.

### Changed

- **`UpdateAvailableBanner.swift`** — Download button relabeled to
  "Update" and now calls `AppState.installUpdate()` instead of
  opening the download URL in a browser.
- **`UpdateRequiredView.swift`** — same wiring for the "Update Now"
  button on the mandatory update screen.
- **`ContentView.swift`** — presents `UpdateWindow` as a sheet with
  `.interactiveDismissDisabled` bound to the pipeline's
  in-flight state.

Pair with Windows client `windows-v0.1.6+` for feature parity.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-04

Client identity telemetry -- every request to the NexGuard server
now carries `X-NexGuard-Client-Platform: macos` +
`X-NexGuard-Client-Version: 0.1.0`. Server records those into the
device row (server >= v3.1.0) so admins see which build each device
is running. Passive telemetry only; no enforcement.

Requires server v3.1.0+ for the new columns; older servers ignore
the headers and everything else keeps working (backwards-compat).

### Added

- New `NexGuardClient` enum (in `App/API/NexGuardClientHeaders.swift`)
  that exposes the platform id + `Bundle.main` marketing version,
  and a `URLRequest.addNexGuardClientHeaders()` extension that
  stamps both onto any outgoing request.
- `NexGuardAPI` calls it from every request builder
  (`getAuthorized` / `postAuthorized` / `deleteAuthorized`); the
  `OAuthClient` calls it from `exchangeCode` / `revoke` / `refresh`.
  Update-manifest fetches to raw.githubusercontent.com stay header-
  less by design.
- Falls back to the literal `"unknown"` if `Bundle.main` can't read
  its own version; the server treats that string as null in the DB
  column so no misleading value ends up in the fleet distribution.

Pair with Windows client `windows-v0.2.0` (both platforms now report
the same identifier pair to the server).

---

## [0.0.11] - 2026-07-03

Menu bar icon refresh + brand parity with the Windows client.

### Changed

- **Menu bar icon** — replaced the SF Symbol `shield` /
  `shield.lefthalf.filled` template with the full-color brand
  shield PNG plus a small phase-color dot in the bottom-right
  corner (Docker / Cloudflare WARP convention). Both platforms
  now read as the same product at a glance.
- **Phase color mapping** — connecting / reconnecting shifted from
  orange to accent blue (`#4F8DFD`) so the palette matches the
  Windows `TrayIconFactory` exactly.

### Added

- New `MenuBarShield.imageset` in `Assets.xcassets/` (16 / 32 / 64
  resolutions sourced from the same AppIcon PNGs).
- `macos/CLAUDE.md` — dev working notes auto-loaded by Claude Code
  (parity with the Windows client's `CLAUDE.md`).

### Fixed

- `scripts/build-dmg.sh` now always runs `xcodegen generate` at
  Step 1 (was: only if `.xcodeproj` was missing). A
  `MARKETING_VERSION` bump in `project.yml` used to silently NOT
  propagate to the app bundle while the DMG filename picked up the
  new number from `$VERSION`.
- Step 7 cleanup — `lsregister -u`s + removes the staging + Release
  `.app` copies so Spotlight no longer surfaces 3 entries for
  "NexGuard Connect" after each build.

---

## [0.0.9] - 2026-06-19

macOS notifications for background events. The popover-only UI meant
the user had no idea when the server kicked them out, the tunnel
self-healed after a WiFi flap, or an admin approved/revoked their
device — they'd only find out next time they happened to open the
menu. UNUserNotificationCenter banners close that gap.

### Added

- **`NotificationService.swift`** (`App/State/`) — thin wrapper over
  `UNUserNotificationCenter`. Idempotent identifiers so a series of
  WiFi flaps doesn't fill Notification Center with five "Reconnected"
  banners; a `ForegroundPresenter` delegate forces banners to display
  even when the popover is open (default UN behavior drops them when
  the app is "foreground", which is wrong for menu bar apps).
- **5 background event notifications**, all NOT user-initiated:
  1. **Session expired** — fires from `forceReSignIn()` (server
     returned 401 / VPN session guard expired).
  2. **Auto-reconnect succeeded** — fires from `hardReconnect()` on
     successful re-up or leftover-tunnel adoption.
  3. **Auto-reconnect failed** — fires from `hardReconnect()` when
     the catch path can't find a live tunnel either.
  4. **Device approved** — fires when `refreshDeviceStatus()` detects
     `pendingApproval → enrolled`.
  5. **Device revoked** — fires when `refreshDeviceStatus()` detects
     any-active-state → `pendingApproval`.
- **Authorization request on every `bootstrap()`** — idempotent; UN
  caches the user's decision after the first prompt and silently
  returns the cached state on subsequent calls.

### Notes

- User-initiated actions (Connect, Disconnect, Sign Out, Switch
  Organization) are deliberately NOT notified — the user is already
  looking at the UI and a banner on top of their own click is noise.
- If the user denies notification permission, `notify(...)` becomes
  a silent no-op. We don't keep prompting.

---

## [0.0.8] - 2026-06-19

Auto update-check infrastructure. Client now polls the public
[nexguard-releases](https://github.com/0xphuong/nexguard-releases) repo
to surface "Update available" / "Update required" prompts when new
versions ship. Closes the gap between tag-push and user-perceived
freshness, and gives admins a force-update lever for security fixes
via the manifest's `minimum` field.

### Added

- **`UpdateChecker.swift`** (`App/API/`) — fetches the public
  `versions.json` manifest from
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/0xphuong/nexguard-releases/main/versions.json`
  on every app launch and every hour thereafter, gated by a 24-hour
  per-device throttle (UserDefaults `updateChecker.lastCheckedAt`).
  Throttle is the right default for a static CDN-cached manifest;
  manual "Check for Updates" bypasses it. Semver comparator handles
  `X.Y.Z` with non-numeric suffixes (`0.0.8-beta` → `0.0.8`).
- **`AppState.updateStatus`** published as
  `.unknown` / `.upToDate` / `.available(version, dl, cl)` /
  `.required(version, dl, cl)`. `.unknown` is the safe default — a
  failed check preserves whatever the UI was already showing rather
  than clearing a real surfaced update.
- **`UpdateAvailableBanner`** — slim accent-tinted strip above the
  popover with `What's new`, `Download`, and ✕. Dismissal is recorded
  per-version in UserDefaults; a newer `latest` re-arms the banner.
- **`UpdateRequiredView`** — full-screen warning that replaces all
  other content when the running build is below `minimum`. Cannot be
  dismissed; user must download a new build to continue.
- **"Check for Updates" menu item** (Advanced ▸) — force-checks the
  manifest, bypassing the 24h throttle. Manual click always produces
  visible feedback:
  - `.available` already dismissed → clears dismissal, banner returns.
  - `.upToDate` → toast "You're up to date." (auto-clear).
  - `.unknown` → toast "Couldn't check for updates. Try again later."
  - `.required` → full-screen modal handles it.

### Changed

- **`MARKETING_VERSION` bumped 0.1.0 → 0.0.8** in `project.yml` (and
  derived `project.pbxproj`). The project file had drifted out of
  sync with the git release tags — the built app reported `0.1.0`
  while tags shipped `0.0.7`. Going forward, every release commit
  must bump `MARKETING_VERSION` to match the tag so update checks
  resolve correctly against the manifest.

### Notes

- A separate repo, `nexguard-releases`, hosts `versions.json` plus
  mirrored changelogs for both the macOS client and the NexGuard
  server. It is the source-of-truth this client polls. Release
  process: tag this repo → bump `versions.json` in `nexguard-releases`
  → copy the new CHANGELOG entry. See
  [`nexguard-releases/README.md`](https://github.com/0xphuong/nexguard-releases#release-process)
  for the canonical workflow.
- Sparkle integration (in-app download + delta updates) remains
  blocked on paid Apple Developer Program; for now `download_url`
  opens the GitHub Releases page in the user's browser.

---

## [0.0.7] - 2026-06-18

Menu layout cleanup + diagnostics. UX-only release; no behavior changes
to auth, tunnel, or network recovery.

### Added

- **Open Web Portal** menu item (⌘P) — opens the active server URL in
  the user's default browser. One-click access to portal-side actions
  (view device, audit log, manage devices) that the client itself
  doesn't expose (`App/Views/ContentView.swift`).
- **Advanced ▸ submenu** groups rare + destructive actions:
  - Remove Current Organization (with `trash` icon)
  - Uninstall Privileged Helper (with `minus.circle` icon)
  - Copy Diagnostic Log (with `doc.on.clipboard` icon)

  Icons substitute for the red-text destructive styling that macOS
  Menus don't render — SwiftUI's `role: .destructive` only colors text
  on iOS context menus and alerts. Role kept for semantic clarity.
- **Copy Diagnostic Log** — copies a compact state snapshot to the
  clipboard (version, build, macOS, state, tunnel health, server, user,
  device, helper status, last handshake, last error). Intended for
  paste-into-support-ticket workflows.
- **Inline app version in About menu** — "About NexGuard Connect (0.0.7)"
  so the build is visible without opening the About panel.
- **Quit menu hint** — when the tunnel is connected, the Quit item
  reads "Quit (VPN stays connected)" instead of "Quit NexGuard
  Connect", clarifying that the tunnel survives app quit (matches
  WireGuard.app / Tailscale / Mullvad behaviour, and our existing
  leftover-tunnel adoption logic).

### Changed

- **Menu structure regrouped** for clearer visual hierarchy: Organizations
  → Account (Open Portal, Sign Out) → Preferences (Launch at Login) →
  Advanced (destructive) → System (About, Quit). Reduced from 5 dividers
  to 4 by consolidating account-related items.
- **Remove Current Organization** moved from top-level menu to the
  Advanced submenu — was sitting next to "Add Organization" with
  identical styling, prone to misclick.

---

## [0.0.6] - 2026-06-18

Robust auto-reconnect on network change + launch at login. Major rewrite of
the WiFi-roam / network-flap handling after observing repeated
disconnect-to-Ready bugs. New design follows the WireGuard.app / Mullvad
pattern: probe before tearing the tunnel down, restart only if probing
fails. Research and code-review behind the rewrite saved to
`docs/network-recovery-research.md`.

### Added

- **Launch at Login** (`App/State/AutoLaunch.swift`, menu item in
  `ContentView`). Uses `SMAppService.mainApp` — no paid Apple Developer
  Program required. Enabled by default on first install (one-time
  `launchAtLogin.defaultApplied` flag); subsequent runs respect the user's
  choice. Refreshed on every menu open in case the user toggled it
  externally via System Settings → Login Items.
- **`TunnelManager.adoptLeftover()`** — sets `startedAt = Date()` when the
  app inherits a tunnel it didn't start. Without this, `stats()` returned
  nil indefinitely and the UI was permanently stuck on "Last handshake: —".
  Called from `bootstrap()` leftover adoption, `connectForce()` catch
  branch, and `hardReconnect()` catch branch.
- **`docs/network-recovery-research.md`** — synthesis + raw output of the
  deep-research workflow (8 confirmed claims with citations to WireGuard,
  Mullvad, Tailscale, Apple DTS) and the code-review workflow (15
  high-severity bugs found across 10 finder angles). Documents why we
  switched from stop-then-start to probe-first.

### Changed

- **Auto-reconnect: probe-first instead of stop-then-start.** Old design
  tore down the tunnel on every NWPath event and tried `wg-quick up`
  before DHCP/DNS/default-route stabilized — both attempts often failed,
  leaving state stuck in `.enrolled` with the 30 s backoff blocking
  recovery. New design:
  1. Mark `tunnelHealth = .degraded` (UI signal only — tunnel kept up)
  2. Debounce 1 s (Mullvad-style)
  3. Poll `wg show` every 2 s for up to 10 s. Fresh handshake newer than
     2× `PersistentKeepalive` = wireguard-go's UDP socket already
     rebound → mark healthy, no restart.
  4. Only if probing fails: hard restart, with backoff stamped on success
     only so a transient failure doesn't lock out recovery.
- **`handlePathUpdate` reacts from `.connected` AND `.reconnecting`** so a
  follow-up path callback (e.g., DHCP just finalized the real lease after
  a link-local intermediate) can refresh recovery in flight.
- **`hardReconnect` on terminal failure stays `.reconnecting`** (not
  `.enrolled`) and schedules a 5 s retry — keeps `handlePathUpdate` armed
  so the next network event can trigger recovery, instead of permanently
  dropping the user to "Ready".
- **`reconnectTask` is now a stored, cancellable handle.** `disconnect()`,
  `signOut()`, `switchTo()`, and `forceReSignIn()` cancel it before
  proceeding. Previously a user clicking Disconnect mid-reconnect would
  see the tunnel resurrect itself a few seconds later.
- **`bootstrap()` adopts leftover tunnel BEFORE spawning the background
  refresh Task** — fixes a race where the background Task could clobber
  the just-adopted `.connected` state with `.enrolled` or
  `.pendingApproval`. The background Task now also respects
  `state == .connected` and skips `enrollDevice()` over an adopted tunnel.

### Fixed

- **WiFi off → on no longer drops the client to "Ready"** when DHCP/DNS
  hasn't fully stabilized. New probe-first design keeps the tunnel
  through the transition; wireguard-go rebinds its UDP socket
  automatically on most network changes.
- **WiFi A → WiFi B roaming (same `en0`) no longer false-positive
  reconnects.** `interfaceIPv4(_:)` now skips link-local (169.254/16) and
  loopback (127/8). `getifaddrs(3)` returns interfaces in unspecified
  order — without filtering, two callbacks on the SAME network could
  return different IPs (DHCP lease vs link-local) and trip a spurious
  "network changed" reconnect.
- **"Last handshake: —" sticking after auto-reconnect adopted a tunnel.**
  Catch-branch adoption paths now call `TunnelManager.adoptLeftover()` to
  sync `startedAt`, so `stats()` works.
- **`infoBanner` re-rendering on every menu open.** Two remaining direct
  `infoBanner = ...` writes (`cleanupOrphanTunnel`, "Device approved" in
  `refreshDeviceStatus`) now route through `showInfoBanner(...)` with
  auto-clear (5 s and 10 s respectively).
- **30-second backoff burning on a failed auto-reconnect.**
  `lastReconnectAt` is stamped ONLY when a hard restart succeeds — a
  failed attempt no longer locks out the next NWPath-driven recovery.

### Technical notes

The rewrite was driven by two background workflows: a deep-research pass
that surfaced the WireGuard.app `wgBumpSockets()` pattern, Mullvad's 1 s
synthetic-offline debounce, Apple DTS guidance ("reachability is not
ground truth"), and Tailscale's `net/netmon` + HTTP captive-portal probe;
and a high-effort code review (10 finder angles, 1-vote verify, sweep)
that confirmed 15 distinct bugs in the previous auto-reconnect
implementation. Full output of both saved to
`docs/network-recovery-research.md` (Appendices A & B).

## [0.0.5] - 2026-06-14

Self-healing tunnel: detect stale handshakes and recover automatically on
network changes.

### Added

- **`TunnelHealth` enum** (`.healthy` / `.degraded`) published in AppState.
  Computed each polling tick from handshake age. Drives menu bar icon color
  and in-app status copy (`App/State/AppState.swift`).
- **Network change detection** via `NWPathMonitor` (Apple's `Network`
  framework). Watches WiFi ↔ Ethernet ↔ Cellular transitions and captive
  portal events. When the path becomes satisfied again while the tunnel is
  up, the client auto-reconnects to force a fresh WireGuard handshake
  against the new local IP / interface — fixes the "Connected but no
  traffic" stale state that appears after laptop sleep/wake or roaming.
  30-second backoff prevents reconnect loops on flappy networks
  (`AppState.startNetworkMonitoring()`, `handlePathUpdate(_:)`,
  `autoReconnectIfStale(reason:)`).
- **Dynamic stale threshold** based on the peer's `PersistentKeepalive`:
  with NexGuard's typical KP=25, a handshake older than ~75 s is flagged
  degraded (3 missed keepalives, min 60 s floor). When KP is disabled, the
  threshold falls back to WireGuard's own `REJECT_AFTER_TIME` of 180 s —
  treats only true session death as degraded, avoiding false positives on
  legitimately-idle tunnels.
- **Health-aware menu bar icon**: 🟢 green when connected + healthy,
  🟠 orange when connected + degraded, distinguishing "we think we're
  connected" from "we are actively talking to the peer"
  (`App/NexGuardConnectApp.swift`).
- **Health-aware ConnectedView**: status text shows "Connection Unstable"
  with warning-colored orb + exclamation icon when degraded — matches the
  menu bar signal so the user sees the same story whether they glance at
  the icon or open the menu (`App/Views/ConnectedView.swift`).

### Changed

- **Stats polling interval**: 2 s → 5 s. 60 % less CPU/battery for the same
  perceived freshness of the Last Handshake row (`startStatsPolling()`).
- **Tear-down hooks**: `disconnect()`, `signOut()`, `forceReSignIn()`, and
  `switchTo()` now all call `stopNetworkMonitoring()` and reset
  `tunnelHealth` so a stale monitor never lingers after the tunnel goes
  away.

### Notes

- No server-side changes. Pairs with NexGuard server 2.1.0+.

[0.0.5]: https://github.com/0xphuong/nexguard-connect/releases/tag/macos-v0.0.5

---

## [0.0.4] - 2026-06-14

Client-side support for the device-approval workflow introduced in NexGuard
server 2.1.0.

### Added

- **`.pendingApproval` state**. After enrollment, when the server returns
  `status="pending"`, the client transitions to the new `.pendingApproval`
  state instead of `.enrolled`. The Connect button is unavailable until
  approval lands (`App/State/AppState.swift`).
- **PendingApprovalView**. Hourglass orb with warning tint, "Pending Approval"
  hero copy, explanatory subtext, and a "Check Status" button that polls the
  server on demand. The user's email + device name display below as context
  (`App/Views/PendingApprovalView.swift`).
- **Automatic status polling**. `verifySession()` (called on every menu open)
  also calls `refreshDeviceStatus()` to catch admin approve / revoke between
  menu opens. When an approval lands:
  - `.pendingApproval` → `.enrolled`
  - Banner: "Device approved. You can now connect."
  When admin revokes an active session:
  - `.enrolled` / `.connected` → `.pendingApproval`
  - Tunnel stops immediately.
- **`NativeEnrollResponse.status`** field — `"pending"` | `"approved"`. Used
  by `enrollDevice()` and `refreshDeviceStatus()` to drive state transitions
  (`App/API/NexGuardAPI.swift`).

### Notes

- Pairs with NexGuard server 2.1.0. Older server versions will return no
  `status` field; the client defaults to `.enrolled` in that case (graceful
  fallback for mixed-version rollout).

[0.0.4]: https://github.com/0xphuong/nexguard-connect/releases/tag/macos-v0.0.4

---

## [0.0.2] - 2026-06-14

First fully-functional release: sign in → auto-enroll → connect, multi-tenant,
MFA-compatible. Pairs with NexGuard server 2.0.1.

### Added

- **Sign in with NexGuard** via `ASWebAuthenticationSession` + PKCE. Opens
  Safari, completes auth at the portal (whatever provider the admin enables —
  Google OIDC, local, magic link, SAML), redirects back to the app via the
  `nexguard-connect://` URL scheme. No native MFA UI required: when the user
  has MFA registered, the existing portal MFA challenge runs in Safari and the
  client receives the code only after MFA verifies (`App/Auth/OAuthClient.swift`, `App/State/AppState.swift`).
- **Auto device enrollment** after sign-in. Client generates a WireGuard
  keypair locally (private key never leaves the device), names the device
  `{hostname} ({hwUUID-prefix})` so the same Mac always maps to one server-side
  device row, then POSTs to `/api/v1/devices/enroll`. The returned `wg-quick`
  config is parsed, the private key is injected over the server's
  `PrivateKey = REPLACE_ME` placeholder, and the result is cached for instant
  reconnect (`App/State/AppState.swift`).
- **One-click Connect / Disconnect**. Tunnel comes up through the bundled
  `wg-quick` CLI (works without paid Apple Developer; will move to NetworkExtension
  when that's available). Pre-flight token refresh on connect catches a stale
  24-hour VPN session before the user stares at a tunnel that has no peer on
  the server.
- **Auto refresh with single-flight lock**. Access JWT (1 h TTL) refreshes
  silently ~5 min before expiry. Concurrent calls share the same in-flight
  task. On `session_expired` (server's 24 h policy), `forceReSignIn(reason:)`
  clears local state and prompts the user to sign in again.
- **Sign Out** revokes the refresh token server-side via
  `POST /api/v1/native/revoke` before wiping local store, so a stolen
  `store.json` can't extend its life.
- **Multi-tenant: per-organization isolation**.
  - `ServerConfig` registry tracks all servers the user has signed into,
    plus which one is currently active.
  - `Keychain` storage is namespaced by server URL — tokens, device ID, WG
    private key, and cached config never leak across organizations.
  - **Onboarding screen** on first launch (or when the user adds another org):
    URL + optional label input, HEAD-ping validation, then auto sign-in.
  - **Organization switcher** in the menu bar ellipsis menu lists every saved
    server with a checkmark on the active one. Switching is instant — local
    state is reloaded, no re-Google-login required.
  - **Deep-link** `nexguard-connect://configure?server=https://...&label=...`
    pre-fills the onboarding view from an emailed onboarding link.
- **Session-expired UX** that respects the server's "Require Auth for VPN
  Sessions" policy. When the server returns `401 session_expired`, the app
  clears state with a clear "Session expired — please sign in again." banner
  and the right action button.
- **Helper install banner** — single inline row when the privileged helper is
  missing. The helper supports `up`, `down`, and `show` subcommands; the last
  one lets the app read real WireGuard handshake state without prompting for
  admin every poll (`App/Helper/HelperInstaller.swift`, `App/Vendor/bin/nexguard-wg-helper`).

### Changed

- **UI redesigned** around a calm utilitarian language:
  - Design tokens (`Palette`, `Typo`, `Space`, `Radius`) replace ad-hoc
    fonts/colors/spacings (`Shared/DesignTokens.swift`).
  - Status orb (64 pt with radial gradient + state-colored glow) is the
    centerpiece. Pulsing ring while `.connecting`/`.reconnecting`, success
    halo when `.connected`, accent-colored shield when `.enrolled`.
  - All states share a `minHeight: 340` so the popover does not jitter when
    transitioning Enrolled → Connecting → Connected.
  - Header strip (logo + ellipsis menu) and content area separated by a
    subtle 0.5-opacity divider; items anchor to corners.
  - About panel is forced to the front via temporary `.regular` activation
    policy + `NSApp.activate()` + close-observer that demotes back to
    `.accessory` (LSUIElement apps default to opening windows behind the
    focused app) (`App/Views/WindowActivator.swift`).
- **Sign out moved into the ellipsis menu** (Tailscale-style). The footer
  strip was removed so the popover stays a stable height as state changes.

### Removed

- Pre-T6 manual workflows that are obsolete now that enrollment is automatic:
  - `Import Config` view + URL scheme handler.
  - `Generate Keypair` view (the app generates one automatically during enroll).
  - `Export .conf` button.
  - `setImportedConfig` flow + the corresponding bootstrap branch.
- RX/TX traffic display in the stats strip — without root, the app could only
  ever show `0 KB` (`wg show` needs root on macOS userspace WG), which was
  misleading. The Last Handshake row remains.
- Dev-mode "real tunnel via wg-quick CLI" banner.

### Fixed

- **Last handshake reset to "now" on every menu open** — every popover open
  was running `bootstrap()` which called `TunnelManager.loadFromPreferences()`,
  which overwrote `startedAt = Date()` when it detected the leftover tunnel.
  Guarded with `startedAt == nil` so the field is set exactly once
  (`App/Tunnel/TunnelManager.swift`).
- **Onboarding view had no Cancel button** when triggered from the menu —
  user had to quit and relaunch to back out. Cancel is now shown when at
  least one server is already configured (first-launch users still must
  complete onboarding to enter the app). ESC also dismisses.
- **Apple's `.relative(presentation: .numeric)` could render small elapsed
  durations as "0 sec." for too long**. Replaced with a deterministic
  formatter (`now` < 2 s, `Xs ago`, `Xm ago`, `Xh Ym ago`, `Xd ago`).
